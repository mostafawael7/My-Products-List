## Quick notes:
- Architecture used: MVVM
- Networking done with URL Session and retry logic
- I’m still improving my unit/UI testing skills — this project includes some foundational examples
- Used Skeleton View for smooth data loading
- The UI works on all screen sizes
- I used [this Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/21664341-Ecommerce-App-Design) as an inspiration for the UI/UX
- Only used 3 third party libraries which are:
  - **SkeletonView**: for smooth loading
  - **SDWebImage**: for image loading
  - **Cosmos**: for displaying star ratings
